Working as part of the European project [GRASP](http://www.grasp-fet.eu/) (**Gra**phene-Based **S**ingle-**P**hoton Nonlinear Optical Devices), I performed experimental studies of the nonlinear optics of surface plasmon polaritons on graphene.

This project was a collaboration with [ICFO](https://www.icfo.eu/), [Universität Wien](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/), [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en/) and The University of Exeter.
