# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Surface waves at microwave frequencies are excited on a zigzag metasurface formed from unit cells comprised of a pair of identical, alternately oriented, rhombic-shaped metal tubes. This particular symmetry leads to diffractive excitation, with polarization selectivity of different orders, of a family of surface waves. Furthermore, the expected band gap at the first Brillouin zone boundary is absent."
